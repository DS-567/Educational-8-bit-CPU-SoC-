## Project Overview

Alongside my undergraduate studies in Electrical & Electronic Engineering at Ulster University, I designed and built a simple 8-bit CPU using discrete TTL ICs on breadboards. What started as an electronics project quickly became a deep interest in computer architecture CPU hardware. Now at the end of my PhD, I revisited the project in my free time and created an improved SoC-based version on PCBs. This updated design will be provided to Ulster University so that other students can interact with and learn how CPUs work. An FPGA implementation and Python simulator of the CPU/SoC will also be shared here soon.

At a time when Artificial Intelligence is becoming mainstream, understanding computer hardware is more important than ever. The goal of this repo is to provide a learning CPU/SoC platform that others can study, rebuild or extend themselves.

This repository will host the complete open-source project, including:

🔨 Schematics, PCB and Gerber files.

🐍 A custom Python assembler.

🖥️ A Python-based CPU emulator/simulator for replicating without the hardware.

💻 An FPGA implementation of the CPU/SoC.

📚 Documentation.

🧩 Example programs and tutorials.
